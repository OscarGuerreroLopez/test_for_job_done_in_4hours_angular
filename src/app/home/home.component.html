    <h4>Description:</h4>
    <p>
      For this exercise I used Angular 6 which is the one I have installed here.
      I created a model module just to store some interfaces to used through the
      movies component and also included a service to make the requests to the
      api to get the movies. Normally I like to have services for the API
      requests and services to process the data separately. Since this project
      is small thatâ€™s why there is only one requests at the movie service. But
      if there would be more then I would create several services depending on
      the project and then just export them in the module.ts
    </p>
    <p>
      I also created a service call movie-details to order the data received
      from the server. Here in a real world app I would do all the data
      manipulations
    </p>
    <p>
      Some of the functionality of the movie component could be done in a
      separate service but since I had no time I created different functions to
      handle the view. I like to keep the components simple, just to handle the
      views for example
    </p>
    <p>
      For step 2, since all the information about the movies comes from the
      first API call to https://swapi.co/api/films/ I decided not to make
      additional calls to the server. In the real world of course I would
      consult this with the right people, backend guys for example. But for this
      project I couldn't ask anyone. Hope it is ok. At the next step I make more
      requests to the server in case you wanted to see how I do them. I did not
      used any libraries like axios for the requests, but it could be done. The
      calls to the server to get the actors are done with forkJoin from rxjs to
      return all data at once
    </p>
    <p>
      Didn't do any unit testing due to the lack of time. Nor i tried to make it
      really pretty, which of course can be done. Just some formatting with
      bootstrap
    </p>
    <p>Please feel free to ask me any doubts or any suggestions</p>
